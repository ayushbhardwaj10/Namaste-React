Agenda of Episode :  We'll see how to make our app more beautiful. We'll see how we can add styles to our applications, how we can add CSS to our
application and then we'll pick a CSS framwework to add style to our whole app 
- We'll learn Tailwind CSS.
////////////////

=> Till now the focus was to make features inside React, but now we'll see how to our app look very beautiful.


Ways to writing CSS : 

1. Single css file for every component

   => Currently we're using a single index.css where we had put CSS of each and every components. Thats a very naive way 
      to write CSS for components.

2. Use Sass and Scss
   (a) Sass
   => Sass : It's like Writing CSS with some superpowers :)

   These are not recommended ways to write CSS since as our app grows, Sass and Scss doesn't grow well. These are not used in industry production
   ready apps. 

   => Companies do not use Sass and CSS of all components in a single file.

 
Whats a recommended ways what developers use ? 
///////////////

3. Styled Components

   => It's used in industry. A lot of big companies used "styled components".

4. Bootstrap, MaterialUI - They give pre-built components

We'll learn Tailwind CSS - It's latest in Front-end community and gaining a lot of popularity.
///////////////

5. Tailwind CSS.

=> It's used to style your component without leaving(switching tab) your HTML. (or JSX)

=> It's a generic library with works with all the front-end frameworks and libraries like React, Angular etc.

=> Lets install it. It's  not installed in a normal way.
 
=> On Tailwind CSS website -> Get Started -> Framework guides -> "Parcel". Note: If we use CLI create react app, we'll use "Create React App".

=> Follow the steps to add Tailwind CSS to your project : https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/parcel
   
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
   npx tailwindcss init

   - It Install two packages for use tailwindcss and postcss. 
   - We install postcss since tailwindcss uses postcss behind the scenes to transform CSS with javascript. 
   - We don't have to learn postcss, tailwindcss uses it in background.
   - npx tailwindcss init : It executes the tailwindcss package and init command with it creates a tailwind.config.js.
   - Parcel uses postcssrc file (mentioned in steps) to understand Tailwind. 
   - (mentioned in steps) 
      content: [
         "./src/**/*.{html,js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
      ],
      It means we can use Tailwindcss in any of these files - html, js, ts, jsx, and tsx.
   
   -  (Explained in steps) - We'll delete all the lines css that we have written till now and just write below three lines. 

      @tailwind base;
      @tailwind components;
      @tailwind utilities; 

      It's a way we import tailwind CSS in our app.

   - We'll not be touching index.css ever again in my project XD.
   - These three lines are only 3 lines we need to write in index.css.

   - Our app is now configured to use Tailwind CSS :)

=> Now our old CSS is gone and toldwind CSS is confugured in our app. We'll now use tailwind to customize the styling in our app. 

=> Tailwind CSS way to add styles :  It gives you  class names for every kind of CSS that you want to add.
   Out thought process will work exactly the same way, we did while using normal CSS files.

=> Lets write CSS for out header component for flex 

=> Initially, it takes some time to learn these classes, but once you start using it, you life will become more and more easy.

6. See  Tailwind vs code extension. It's an awesome VS code Extension which gives you suggestions for all the tailwind classes and if you 
   hover over a class, it tells you what the tailwind CSS is doing behind the scenes in plain css.

=> What if there's not class for width 200px. You can use dynamic tailwind using this : 
  
   <div className="w-[200px]"> 
     .....
   </div>

7. Disadvantage of Tailwind CSS
   => Sometimes the number of classes that we add become a lot and our code starts looking ugly with soo many tailwind classes.
   => Other than this, Tailwind is amazing. It makes your life very very easy and it promotes faster development.


8. Tailwind CSS continue....

(Important) ****** 

=> Major Advantage of Tailwind : 
  - Tailwin css is very light weight. Suppose in our code, we use specific classes. When parcel makes a bundle of css. It only import the CSS
   that are absolutely required for our app. If we have multiple "m-4" classes in our app. It'll import m-4 only 1 and use it multiple times.

  - Tailwind automatically removes all unused CSS when building for production. Mostly people use a lot of redudant classes. Tailwind CSS makes sure,
    there's not redudant and unused classes in your bundle for dev and prod enviornments.

  - Build whatever complex UI you can build. You are restricted to anything. You have a class for everything. Eg : You have classes for hover as well.

  - You can also build responsive applications.

  - Very easy to build dark mode. Today, everyone is shifting to dark mode. Usually, it's very very difficult to build dark mode from scratch.
